# Introduction

This library allows adding SAML Service Provider (SP) support to your PHP web
application and interface with SAML Identity Providers (IdPs).

**NOTE**: this library did NOT receive a security audit. Do **NOT** use it in
production until there is a 1.0 release!

# Why

I wanted to have a minimal implementation of a SAML SP library. Exiting (PHP) 
software either has a much larger scope, or tries to conform fully to the SAML 
specification. This library only tries to implement the minimum amount to work 
with real world deployed IdPs and be secure at all times.

# Features

- Only SAML SP functionality
- Only HTTP-Redirect for sending `AuthnRequest`, `LogoutRequest` to IdP
- Only HTTP-Redirect binding for receiving `LogoutResponse` from IdP
- Only HTTP-POST binding for receiving `Response` from IdP
- Only supports RSA with SHA256 for signing/verifying signatures
- Only supports AES-256-GCM for `EncryptedAssertion`
- Always signs `AuthnRequest`
- Always signs `LogoutRequest`
- Supports signed `samlp:Response` and/or signed 
  `samlp:Response/saml:Assertion`
- Allow specifying `AuthnContextClassRef` as part of the `AuthnRequest`
- No dependency on `robrichards/xmlseclibs`
- Serializes `eduPersonTargetedId` as `idpEntityId!spEntityId!persistentId` 
  like Shibboleth;
- Validates XML schema(s) when processing XML protocol messages
- Tested with IdPs:
  - [simpleSAMLphp](https://simplesamlphp.org/)
  - [OpenConext](https://openconext.org/)
  - [FrkoIdP](https://github.com/fkooman/php-saml-idp/)
  - [AD FS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Directory_Federation_Services)
- Currently ~1300 NCLOC

# X.509

Use the following command to create a self-signed certificate for use with the
SP library.

    $ openssl req \
        -nodes \
        -subj "/CN=SAML SP" \
        -x509 \
        -sha256 \
        -newkey rsa:2048 \
        -keyout "sp.key" \
        -out "sp.crt" \
        -days 1800

# Example

Two examples are provided in the `example/` directory. In order test them:

    $ /path/to/composer install
    $ php -S localhost:8081 -t example

The example performs authentication and shows the attributes received from the 
IdP. It also supports logout at the IdP if supported by the IdP.

With your browser you can go to 
[http://localhost:8081/](http://localhost:8081/). The example will redirect 
immediately to the IdP. The metadata of the SP can be found at this URL: 
`http://localhost:8081/metadata`

# IdP Configuration

Make sure:

- the IdP signs the `saml:Assertion` and/or the `samlp:Response`;
- the IdP does NOT encrypt the `saml:Assertion`, i.e. it MUST NOT send a 
  `saml:EncryptedAssertion`, or supports `AES-256-GCM`;
- the IdP verifies the signature on the `samlp:AuthnRequest`;
- the IdP verifies the signature on the `samlp:LogoutRequest`;
- the IdP signs the `samlp:LogoutResponse`.

## simpleSAMLphp

In your simpleSAMLphp's `metadata/saml20-sp-remote.php` file, configure this 
for this SP library:

    'validate.authnrequest' => true,
    'saml20.sign.assertion' => true,
    'sign.logout' => true,
    'validate.logout' => true,

As of writing, simpleSAMLphp does not support `EncryptedAssertion` with 
AES-256-GCM.

# Tests

In order to run the tests:

    $ /path/to/composer install
    $ vendor/bin/phpunit

# Browser Session

You MUST secure your PHP cookie/session settings. See 
[this](https://paragonie.com/blog/2015/04/fast-track-safe-and-secure-php-sessions) 
resource.
